# Breakeven-Tool-for-Hospitals-and-Physicians - Healthcare Python Project

This is a graph that will require you to enter 3 inputs after running on any python complier like Juypter Notebook or Google Collab. 

1. Enter the full time employee hourly rate.
2. Enter the full time employee onboarding fee. 
3. Enter the locum hourly rate. 

Once you enter the inputs for the 3 prompts; 

A graph will be displayed which shows the breakeven point or intersection point for the number of hours that a locum will cost more for the hospital to keep 
in the long run. This will be helpful for hospitals to decide wether to hire a locum or a full time employee based on the number of hours.

For example: 

Enter the full time employee hourly rate ($) = 100

Enter the full time employee onboarding fee ($) = 50000

Enter the locum employee hourly rate ($) = 500

The breakeven point for these values are 125 hours. Which means that after 125 hours, the hospital will incur more costs for the locum as compared to hiring 
the full time employee. 

It is better to hire a full time employee in this scenario, although the inital onboarding of $50000 has to be invested, but in the long run(i.e after 125 hours) the hospital will end up spending more money if they hired a locum. 

This project was part of the academic paper done for Drexel Scholars Medical School program.
